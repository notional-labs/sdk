# sdk
Notional's carefully versioned monorepo for: cosmos-sdk, tendermint, ibc-go, tm-db, and more.  


## Rationale
After a good deal of fiddling with the Cosmos-SDK and starport, or sdk via stapot, I've come to realize that it is very difficult to maintiain Starport applicaitons over time, and that this is due to the reality that there are many disjointed teams working in cosmos, with IBC the only glue.  


## Goal
As quickly as I can with starport, or faster, this SDK will allow even non-developers to put a cosmos-sdk blockchain together.  Fo more advanced users, this means that interfaces are more standardized than they currently are today.  


## Stack components

* SOS
* Tendermint
* Cosmos-SDK
* Gaia (application template)
